# Initial Route Hypothesis: Coastal Path

## Overview
Based on the summary of Jocelin's Vita, this document proposes a plausible route for St Mungo's journey from Culross to Glasgow and his later exile to Wales and return. The hypothesis currently focuses on coastal and maritime travel, which would have been the most practical for long-distance movement in the early medieval period.

## Proposed Route

### 1. Culross to Glasgow (c. 550–560 CE)
- **Coastal sailing along the Firth of Forth**: From Culross, Mungo would have taken a small boat across the Forth to the southern shore.
- **Overland portage to the Clyde**: A short overland trek to the River Clyde, possibly via the Kelvin valley.
- **Riverine travel up the Clyde**: Using the Clyde to reach the site of Glasgow.

### 2. Exile to Wales (c. 560–570 CE)
- **Maritime route via the Irish Sea**: Departing from the Clyde estuary, sailing south along the western coast of Britain.
- **Landfall in Glywysing**: Making landfall in the Glamorgan region, perhaps at a port like Cardiff (Caerdydd) or the mouth of the River Taff.
- **Overland travel to Llanelwy**: Moving north through Wales to St Asaph.

### 3. Return to Glasgow (c. 570–580 CE)
- **Reverse maritime journey**: Sailing north from Wales, possibly hugging the coast of Cumbria and Galloway.
- **Entry via the Solway Firth**: Using the Solway as a sheltered approach, then overland through Annandale to the Clyde valley.

## Rationale for Coastal Focus
1. **Safety and speed**: Coastal sailing avoided hostile inland territories and rough terrain.
2. **Historical precedent**: Early medieval saints' lives often mention sea travel (e.g., St Columba).
3. **Archaeological evidence**: There is evidence of early medieval trading and travel along the western British seaboard.

## Limitations and Questions
- This hypothesis does not fully consider the possibility of overland routes that might have been used in conjunction with coastal segments.
- The influence of older Roman roads (like the western extension of Dere Street) is not explored.
- The connection between Strathclyde and Glywysing may have involved a more direct overland corridor through the Southern Uplands.

## Next Steps
- Examine historical maps and place‑name evidence for early medieval routes.
- Investigate the potential for ridgeway paths across the Southern Uplands.
- Compare with other hagiographical accounts of cross‑Britain journeys.
