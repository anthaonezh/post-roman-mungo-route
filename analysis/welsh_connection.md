# The Welsh Connection: An Overland Route Hypothesis

## Introduction
The `jocelin_summary.md` notes that St Mungo (Kentigern) travelled to Wales during his exile and later returned to Glasgow. This movement implies a direct link between the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Welsh kingdom of Glywysing. While the initial hypothesis favours a coastal maritime route, an overland corridor through the Southern Uplands deserves serious consideration.

## Geographical Framework
A plausible overland route would connect the Clyde valley with the Welsh Marches via the Solway basin and the valleys of the Southern Uplands. Key segments include:

1. **Clyde to Solway**: Using the valley of the River Clyde downstream to the vicinity of modern Lanark, then crossing the low watershed into Annandale (River Annan). This corridor follows the natural grain of the landscape and avoids the highest uplands.

2. **Annandale to the Solway Firth**: The Annan flows south to the Solway, providing a natural highway to the coast. At the Solway, travellers could either cross the firth (by boat or at low tide) or skirt its eastern shore.

3. **Solway to Wales**: From the Solway plain, an overland route could strike south‑west through the Eden valley and across the Pennine fringe into what is now Cumbria, then onward via the Cheshire Gap into north Wales. Alternatively, a more westerly track could follow the coast of Cumberland and enter Wales via the Conwy or Dee estuaries.

## Historical Precedent: Ridgeways and Roman Roads
Pre‑Roman and Roman routeways provided the skeleton for early medieval travel. Dere Street, the Roman road running north from York to the Firth of Forth, had a western branch that likely extended toward the Clyde. Although its exact alignment in the post‑Roman period is debated, the corridor it defined—along the watershed between the Tyne and the Solway—would have remained a known thoroughfare.

Similarly, the **Maiden Way** (a Roman road linking the Stainmore Pass with the Solway) and other minor Roman roads could have facilitated movement across the Pennines. These routes would have been maintained as ridgeways long after Roman administration ceased, used by local populations, traders, and ecclesiastical travellers.

## Implications for Mungo’s Journey
If Mungo (or his companions) utilised such overland tracks, his exile and return could have been accomplished without relying solely on sea travel. This would align with other early medieval saints’ lives that describe cross‑Britain journeys via interior routes (e.g., St Cuthbert’s travels). Moreover, an overland corridor would have allowed contact with Christian communities in the borderlands, possibly explaining the spread of cults and artistic styles between Strathclyde and Wales.

## Archaeological Corroboration
Future research should examine archaeological evidence along the proposed corridor:
- Early medieval settlement sites (e.g., Trusty’s Hill fort in Galloway)
- Place‑names indicative of early Christian activity (eccles‑ names, *llan*‑ names in Wales)
- Finds of 6th‑ to 7th‑century metalwork or pottery that might signal exchange networks.

## Conclusion
Incorporating an overland route into the analysis enriches our understanding of early medieval connectivity. It underscores that travel in post‑Roman Britain was multi‑modal, combining river, road, and sea according to season, politics, and purpose. The Welsh connection thus becomes not just a footnote about exile, but a window into the living network that linked the Celtic kingdoms of the west.
